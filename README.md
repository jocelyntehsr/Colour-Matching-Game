Then, gfx.c and gfx.h file must be downloaded in order to execute the game.

# Game Play

This colour matching game has three stages, in which:

1st stage: find two blocks that have same colour and click them one after another.

2nd stage: find two different shapes with same colour and click them one after another.

3rd stage: find two blocks with same shape and same colour, then click them one after another.

Players use mouse to play the game while they can press 'Q' on the keyboard to quit it.

The positions of the shapes and their colours are assigned randomly. 

After each stage, the time taken to complete will be shown. There is limited time for each gameplay so make sure you can finish it as fast as possible!
